Operational Transformation for Multimedia

## TODO
1. support objects[i].type
2. improve support for imported images
3. deploy on a French server
4. handle non-trivial conflicts

## Ideas
- generate conflicts
- overlapping (3D?)
- import objects (bitmaps/images, videos)
- subdivide/merge objects to rework them
- data growth? garbage collection?
- delays?

## Current state
- Thanks to undo-redo support we can generate conflicts.
- We can import & export images.
- No scaling, but we can let users chose the size of the canvas.
